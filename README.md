= Scala Servlet

This is an example servlet written in pure Scala.  I wrote it as a jumping off point for simple Scala web apps, and you're welcome to reuse it however you like.

It also includes the Maven config for running Specs, plus an example.

== Common Commands

* `mvn test` - runs the Specs.
* `mvn jetty:run` - runs the app in Jetty.
* `mvn war:war` - builds a .war file for the app.

== What's Next?

I'll update the app when Scala 2.8 and Specs are released as stable.  If you'd like to contribute any of your own tricks or configuration options, you're welcome to!
